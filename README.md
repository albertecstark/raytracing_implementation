This project is my implementation of raytracing, inline with the tutorial [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), and its sequel [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)

The code is currently quite simple, things I want to add are;

- More primitives (cuboids, cylinders, triangles)
- The ability to import meshes
- UV mapping
- coloured lights
- GPU parallisation through OpenCL
